# Digit-Guesser-Neural-Network
This program allows the user to draw a number on the screen and the program predicts the digit drawn using a neural network model.


This program is my version for solving the MNIST Digit data set also focusing on the reproducibility and the scalability of the model.

Created a GUI using pygame that allows user to draw a number on the screen and uses the created model to predict the number in real time.


Accuracy of the model --> 95.7%
